# Cyclops

Cyclops is a single-page application (SPA) that displays real-time data
from an instance of [Cyphon](https://dunbarcyber.github.io/cyphon/).
It's built on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and served
through an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server.

Cyclops allows you to easily view, assign, and investigate Cyphon
alerts. It provides an “eye” into your data, enabling you to respond to
issues quickly and effectively.

See [Cyclops' documentation](http://cyphon-ui.readthedocs.io/) for
more info.
