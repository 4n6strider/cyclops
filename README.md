# Cyclops

Cyclops is a single-page application (SPA) that displays real-time data from an instance of [Cyphon](https://dunbarcyber.github.io/cyphon/). It's built on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and served through an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server.

Cyclops allows you to easily view, assign, and investigate Cyphon alerts. It provides an “eye” into your data, enabling you to respond to issues quickly and effectively.

See [Cyclops' documentation](http://cyphon-ui.readthedocs.io/) for more info.
