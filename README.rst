Cyclops
#######

Cyclops is a single-page application (SPA) that displays real-time data
from an instance of `Cyphon <https://cyphon.readthedocs.io/>`__.
It's built on `React <https://facebook.github.io/react/>`__ and served
through an `Express <https://expressjs.com/>`__ server.

Cyclops allows you to easily view, assign, and investigate Cyphon
alerts. It provides an “eye” into your data, enabling you to respond to
issues quickly and effectively.

See `Cyclops' documentation <http://cyphon-ui.readthedocs.io/>`_ for
more info.
