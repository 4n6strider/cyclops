Migrating from 0.3 to 0.4
*************************

The latest version of Cyclops no longer has it's own Express server.
It turned into a complex piece of middleware between the client
and the Cyphon API that was duplicating a lot of functionality already
present in the Cyphon system for the sake of code separation. At some point
during our deployment cycle for our in house version of Cyphon, this
unnecessary overhead caused some difficulties which forced us to integrate it
by pulling a compiled version of Cyclops into the template using a CDN.

The benefit of this is that it's now incredibly easy to use Cyclops with
Cyphon now. In the Cyphon ``conf.py`` configuration file there is a
section dealing with Cyclops::

    CYCLOPS = {
        'ENABLED': True,
        'VERSION': '0.4.0',
        'CDN_FORMAT': 'https://cdn.rawgit.com/dunbarcyber/cyclops/{0}/dist/cyclops.{1}',
        'MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN': '',
        'LOCAL_ASSETS_ENABLED': False,
        'LOCAL_ASSETS_PATH': os.path.abspath(os.path.join(PROJ_DIR, '../../cyclops/build')),
        'LOCAL_FOLDER_NAME': 'cyclops',
        'LOCAL_CSS_FILENAME': 'cyclops.css',
        'LOCAL_JS_FILENAME': 'cyclops.js',
    }

This will be enabled by default on Cyphon version 1.2+. The only other thing to
do is signup for a mapbox access token `here <https://www.mapbox.com/studio/signup/>`_
and set it as ``'MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN'`` to see maps and get geolocation data.
