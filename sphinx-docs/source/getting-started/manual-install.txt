Manual Install
##############

If you'd prefer to install Cyclops manually (rather than using :ref:`Docker<docker-install>`), you can do so through the following steps.

.. _dependencies:

********************
Install Dependencies
********************

First, make sure `Node <https://nodejs.org>`_ is downloaded onto your system, using either your OS system's package manager or by using one of the `installers <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`__ on Node's website.

Once that's done, clone the `Cyclops Git repository <https://github.com/dunbarcyber/cyclops>`_ onto your computer, change into the root directory of the project, and run::

    $ npm install

This should download all the dependencies for the project into a folder called `node_modules`.


*****************
Configure Project
*****************

Configure your project by following the instructions :ref:`here<configuration>`.


.. _build-app:

*****************
Build Application
*****************

When you first download this repository, it's simply a collection of source files. These must be built into the files that will be used to run the application. To do this, run::

    $ npm run build

This will compile all the source files from `src` into the directory `build`. More details on this process can be found in the Build Process section. 


.. _start-express:

********************
Start Express Server
********************

To the start the server::

    $ npm run server:prod

This will start an express server at `localhost` with the port number being the value set on environment variable :ref:`cyclops-port`, or port `3000` if it's not set. When you visit that URL, you should see a login page. Use any login information present on the Cyphon instance to log into the application.
