Cyclops is most easily installed using `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_.
If you'd like to use our Docker Compose files for installing both Cyphon
Engine and Cyclops, you can find them on GitHub at
`Cyphondock <https://github.com/dunbarcyber/cyphondock>`_. If you'd prefer
to work directly with the Cyclops image, you can find it
`here <https://hub.docker.com/r/dunbar/cyclops/>`__.

See `Cyphon's documentation <https://cyphon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/configure-server.html>`__ for more details.
