Important Recent Changes
************************

Cyphon version 1.2 and onward will contain the most recent version of
Cyclops with it. This new Cyphon version also serves the Cyclops assets
instead of the Express server in Cyclops version 0.3. Due to this new
functionality, the express server has been removed in Cyclops version 0.4.
All of this means that this getting-started section is deprecated. To
see how to configure Cyclops on Cyphon version 1.2+, view the Cyphon
documentation `here <http://cyphon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/configure-project.html#cyclops>`.
