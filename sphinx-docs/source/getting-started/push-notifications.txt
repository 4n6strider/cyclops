All of the information to get push notifications setup is on this page. At first, you won't have a server key. Click the button that says "ADD SERVER KEY" in the top right to create a server key.

Once you have this key, you need to place it in your Cyphon settings conf.py file. There is a setting called NOTIFICATIONS. Set NOTIFICATIONS.PUSH_NOTIFICATION_KEY to your created server key.

After that, go back to the firebase "CLOUD MESSANGING" tab and look at the "Sender ID" credential. Take this value and place it in the Cyclops 'cyclops.env' as GCM_SENDER_ID. You should see an example of it in 'cyclops.env.COPYME'.

After you've set these two credentials, startup your Cyphon instance and vist the admin page. Visit the url '/constance/config/'. You should see a configuration for PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED.
