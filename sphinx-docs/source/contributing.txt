API Documentation
*****************

Documentation for the Cyclops API is generated by following command::

    $ npm run docs

This will create HTML in a directory named `docs` that outlines all the individual components that make up the the express server and react application, and creates search functionality for all those components.

.. _code-style:

Code Style
**********

General
=======

The style uses `Typescript's coding guidelines <https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines>`_ and `TSLint rules <https://palantir.github.io/tslint/>`_ with a few exceptions. These exceptions are outlined in the ``tslint.json`` file at the root of the project directory.

TSLint is run on every webpack compilation. If there are any style errors, there should be a warning/error in the webpack console output.

.. _code-style-typescript-redux:

Typescript Redux
================

There's a specific way to write redux actions and reducers that make it type safe. There are a few utilities and types to help with this process.

.. _code-style-typescript-redux-actions:

actions
-------

::
    
    // Helper function that creates a type safe action.
    import { createAction } from 'utils/createReduxAction';
    import {
      // Redux action type.
      ReduxAction,

      // Thunk action type that returns a promise.
      ThunkActionPromise,

      // Thunk action that doesn't return anything.
      ThunkActionVoid,
    } from 'types/redux';

    /**
     * Action type prefix to differentiate this set of actions from another
     * set of actions.
     * @type {string}
     */
    const ACTION_PREFIX = 'NAME';

    // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // CHANGE_NAME
    // --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    /**
     * Action Type: Action description goes here.
     * @type {string}
     */
    export const CHANGE_NAME = `${ACTION_PREFIX}/CHANGE_NAME`;

    /** CHANGE_NAME payload type. */
    export type ChangeNamePayload = string;

    /** CHANGE_NAME action type. */
    export type ChangeNameAction = ReduxAction<ChangeNamePayload>;

    /**
     * Creates a(n) CHANGE_NAME action.
     * @returns {ChangeNameAction}
     */
    export function changeName(payload: string): ChangeNameAction {
      return createAction(EXAMPLE, payload);
    }

    // --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Thunk Actions
    // --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    /**
     * Returns a redux thunk action that returns a promise.
     * @param arg Example argument
     * @returns {ThunkActionPromise}
     */
    export function thunkPromise(arg: string): ThunkActionPromise {
      return (dispatch, getState) => {
        return promise(arg).then((response) => {
          dispatch(changeName(response))
        });
      };
    }

    /**
     * Returns a redux thunk action that returns nothing.
     * @param arg Example argument
     * @returns {ThunkActionPromise}
     */
    export function thunkVoid(arg: string): ThunkActionVoid {
      return (dispatch, getState) => {
        dispatch(changeName(arg));
      };
    }

.. _code-style-typescript-redux-reducer:

reducer
-------

::
    
    // Third party library that helps create redux reducers and actions.
    import {
      // Creates the reducer for us from a reducer map.
      handleActions,
      // Object type that holds indexed reducer functions.
      ReducerMap,
    } from 'redux-actions';
    import * as _ from 'lodash';

    // Actions and actions types defined earlier.
    import * as actions from '../actions/actions';

    /** State shape of the reducer. */
    export interface State {
      name: string;
    }

    /**
     * Initial state of the reducer.
     * @type {State}
     */
    const INITIAL_STATE: State = {
      name: '',
    };

    /** Object that maps action types to their reducer functions. */
    const reducers: ReducerMap<State, any> = {};

    /**
     * Updates the reducer based on a(n) CHANGE_NAME action.
     * @param state Current reducer state.
     * @param action CHANGE_NAME action.
     * @returns {State} Updated reducer state.
     */
    reducers[actions.CHANGE_NAME] = (
      state: State,
      action: actions.ChangeNameAction,
    ): State => {
      // This checks if the update matches some of the state shape.
      const update: Partial<State> = {
        name: action.payload,
      };

      return _.assign({}, state, update);
    };

    /**
     * Combined reducer from reducer map.
     * @type {Reducer<State, any>}
     */
    export const reducer = handleActions<State, any>(reducers, INITIAL_STATE);

After creating a new reducer, link the State type to the main redux state shape in **store.ts** so that any references to the store state are type checked.

.. _tests:

Testing
*******

Tests use `Mocha <https://mochajs.org/>`_ as the testing framework, `Chai <http://chaijs.com/>`_ as the assertion library, `Sinon <http://sinonjs.org/>`_ for mocking, `Enzyme <http://airbnb.io/enzyme/>`_ for react component rendering, and `Karma <https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html>`_. as the rest runner. Any test file created should have the suffix ``.spec.ts`` or ``.spec.tsx`` and placed next to the file it's testing.

All test commands should produce coverage information in `coverage`.

::

    $ npm run test

This command looks for files in ``src`` that end with ``.spec.ts`` or ``.spec.tsx`` and runs them through `Karma <https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html>`_ once. Also creates a JSON coverage report in ``coverage`` that's used to create any HTML or lcov coverage reports.

::

    $ npm run test:watch

This command runs the test runner in watch mode so that any changes to the source files triggers the tests to run again.

::

    $ npm run travis

This command should only be run by `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/>`_ because it sends test coverage to coveralls, which fails in any other environment.

.. _dev-task

Development Environment
***********************

::

    $ npm run dev

Running this command will start a couple of concurrent processes that make it easier to develop Cyclops. Whenever you make changes to the express source code, it restarts the server. Whenver you make changes to the react or scss source code, it sends a livreload request to the browser asking it to reload the webpage.

NPM Tasks
*********
- **webpack:dev:** Runs webpack in watch mode.
- **webpack:prod:** Runs webpack in production mode, which results in a minified webpack output.
- **test:watch:** Runs tests in watch mode.
- **test:** Runs tests once and creates a JSON coverage report.
- **travis:** Runs tests once and sends the coverage report to coveralls.
- **docs:api:** Builds API documentation into ``api-docs``.
